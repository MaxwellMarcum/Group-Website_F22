# Group-Website_F22
This Repository contains code snipits from a group project, where we created (As of 11/16/22 this project is ongoing) a Trip planning website.
Most of my work centered around Friend functionalities, creating and displaying trips that have been made, and Maps that would display locations of trips.

This website made heavy use of Python, flask, SQLite and Folium
These Snipits are complety my work, any collabritive work has not been shown here hence the references to html files that have not been included.
